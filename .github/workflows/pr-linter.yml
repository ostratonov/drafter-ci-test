            The subject "{subject}" found in the pull request title "{title}"
            didn't match the configured pattern. Please ensure that the subject
            has BLS or STS ticket number, and it is wrapped up in brackets.
            For example, "improved performance, (BLS-1234)".
            If there are two or more tickets provided, use next formatting: 
            "improved performance, (BLS-1234, BLS-1235)"
